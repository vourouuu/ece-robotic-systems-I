# ECE - Robotic Systems I
This course, taught by Associate Professor [Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis](https://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/el/faculty/chatzilygeroudis.html), is part of the 8th semester curriculum at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras. Throughout the semester, we were assigned four practical exercises, which I have included in this Git repository.
